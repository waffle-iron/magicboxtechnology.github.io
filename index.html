          <h1 class="c-product__description-title">Private DataVault™</h1>
          <p class="c-product__description-text">A Private DataVault™ (PDV) is a highly secure; completely anonymous, self-service digital vault for storing the private &amp; personal data that belongs to your customers and employees, that allows them to share and control access in a simple, clear and unified manner.</p>
          <p>The PDV provides two clear solutions:</p>
          <p><em>Data Consumers (Organisations)</em>, although tangentially related to GDPR, it is fundamentally agnostic to any specific regulatory requirements. It will allow you to mitigate your legal and regulatory risks resulting from managing and storing your end users private data. Whilst maximising the benefits of scalable data processing, alongside clear and unambiguous management, reporting and analysis.</p>
          <p><em>Data Owners (Consumers)</em>, your data belongs to you. It allows you to control exactly what and how much you say to other people and organisations. As well as always knowing exactly what they are doing with your data and how they are using it. Confident, that your data is safe, secure and available when you need it.</p>
          <p>A Private DataVault™ introduces the concept of Personas™ and tokens. Tokenization will greatly reduce your risk within the organisation and enable compliance through anonymity. Personas™ allow the Data Owner to grant pertinent access to the data for use by a specific predefined group such as the marketing team.</p>
          <p>Only you and the intended recipient can access Personas™ held in a Private DataVault™.</p>

          <h1 class="c-company__about-title">About Magicbox</h1>
          <p class="c-company__about-text">Magicbox is a software technology company founded in March 2015, with a goal to create a secured Personal Information Management Service (PIMS) that enables consumers to manage their personal data securely with a single point of control and share with their preferred business providers. We have now created a Software As A Service (SAAS) platform architecture built around a concept of a Private DataVault™. Each Private DataVault™ is a secured, encrypted channel between a consumer and the service provider or business.</p>
          <p class="c-company__about-text">With a strong technical background in Node.js and web technologies, our development team brings solid experience of delivering highly secure, scalable server side software architectures.</p>

          <h1 class="c-company__about-title">Background</h1>
          <p class="c-company__about-text">In this day and age, your business is probably defined by the digital assets it holds and secures, specifically the personal data on your customers and users.  Despite what you might think, in the current regulatory environment, the customer information you hold isn’t yours anymore, it legally no longer belongs to you - you are in reality its custodian and actually just borrowing it.</p>
          <p class="c-company__about-text">The simple uncomfortable truth; is that the data that defines some of your most important business assets belong to the customers that gave it to you, whether directly or indirectly - and now they can ask for it back.  Even when they are happy to share it with you, they are legally empowered to dictate what it contains, when &amp; how you process it and how long you can hold it for.</p>
          <p class="c-company__about-text">This in itself poses enormous data management and regulatory compliance challenges, but it also offers tremendous opportunities - to build more trust, a better relationship and a deeper understanding. By using Magicbox’s Private DataVault™ you can build trust with your customers with complete transparency allowing them to see and control the data that belongs to them.</p>
