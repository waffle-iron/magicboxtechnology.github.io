                        <p><b>On the 25th May 2008</b>, the European Commission will bring into effect the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) which will have an impact on data privacy
                            law across europe and the wider world.  The consequences surrounding data management and security have significantly increased and should be understood.

                        <p>The rapid change of technology paired with the globalisation of the economy has renderd many independant regulations obsolete, individuals are now more at risk of

                            GDPR will replace the 1995 Data Protection Directive and, in the UK, the Data Protection Act (DPA) 1998. Whilst existing DPA measures will contribute to GDPR compliance,
                            the way data is stored and managed is changing and applies to a small business or a club in the same way as it applies to a global conglomerate.

                        <h2>What's driving this change?</h2>
                        <p>
                            The first personal data regulation came into force twenty years ago. Since then the progress of technology and the way personal information is used has adapted
                            significantly and therefore creates the need for greater and more complex regulation.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Originally the value of personal data was largely limited to private information but greater value is now placed on the exchange, gathering and analyzing of personal
                            data to create improved insight to a consumer’s needs and desires. Analytics is now a major part of any business strategy including the use of personal data. This
                            personal data is now an important factor in economic value for data availability.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            GDPR has been introduced to cope with the personal data’s newly acquired weight and place the personal data ownership firmly back to the consumer
                            (or original owner of the data). The right to confidentiality alone will not cover the multitude of innovative use cases and therefore a more complex data protection
                            method has been introduced.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The digital economy now functions well beyond a country's borders and with this globalization regulation needs to be introduced that can protect a consumer regardless
                            of attack/use point. GDPR represents European based individuals and the use of their personal data regardless of business location.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Whilst existing regulations have come a long way towards protecting the individual, the growing misuse of personal data with technology innovation is highlighting the
                            shortcomings of existing regulations such as the Data Protection Act and therefore specific process like the right to be forgotten are being introduced to place the
                            consumers back in control.

                        <p>
                            The speed, and lack of transparency relating to the usage of personal data is limiting individual's ability to understand who has access to their data and exercise
                            their digital rights.

                            Without knowing how data is being transferred or the purpose for which it is being transferred, it is impossible for individuals to prevent potentially damaging misuse.

                        <h3>Has inaccurate personal information been used against you?</h3>

                            Existing regulations are failing to protect individuals from practices such as contractor blacklisting (restricting opportunity), demographic profiling
                            (quality of service) and behavioural profiling (financial premiums).

                                significantly strengthen the position of the Polish regulator and will require an appropriate revision of the entrepreneurs’ approach to the data protection issues.</q>

                            In this day and age, your business is probably defined by the digital assets it holds and secures, specifically the personal data on your customers and users.
                            Despite what you might think, in the current regulatory environment, the customer information you hold isn’t yours anymore, it legally no longer belongs to you
                             - you are actually its custodian and in reality just 'borrowing' it.

                        <p>
                            The simple uncomfortable truth is that the data that defines some of your most important business assets belongs to the customers that gave it to you, whether
                            directly or indirectly - and now they can ask for it back.  Even when they are happy to share it with you, they are legally empowered to dictate what it contains,
                            when &amp; how you process it and how long you can hold it for.
