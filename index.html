                        <h2>Changes to Data Privacy Law</h2>
                        <p><b>On the 25th May 2008</b>, the European Commission will bring into effect the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) which will have an impact on data privacy
                            law across europe and the wider world.  The consequences surrounding data management and security have significantly increased and should be understood.
                        </p>
                        <p>After four years of deliberation, we have arrived at a common consensus for a modern approach to data privacy law.  The rapid change of technology paired
                            with the globalisation of our economy have rendered many independant regulations obsolete as we find individual at risk of harm due to the large volumes
                            of unprotected personal data being exchanged.

                        <h2>Will these changes affect me?</h2>
                        <p>GDPR will replace the 1995 Data Protection Directive and, in the UK, the Data Protection Act 1998.  Whilst existing DPA measures will contribute to GDPR compliance,
                        the way you store and manage data is changing.</p>

                        <p>
                            In this day and age, your business is probably defined by the digital assets it holds and secures, specifically the personal data on your customers and users.
                            Despite what you might think, in the current regulatory environment, the customer information you hold isn’t yours anymore, it legally no longer belongs to you
                             - you are actually its custodian and in reality just 'borrowing' it.
                        </p>
                    </div>

                    <div>
                        <h2>And if you don't own it...</h2>
                        <p>
                            The simple uncomfortable truth is that the data that defines some of your most important business assets belongs to the customers that gave it to you, whether
                            directly or indirectly - and now they can ask for it back.  Even when they are happy to share it with you, they are legally empowered to dictate what it contains,
                            when &amp; how you process it and how long you can hold it for.
                        </p>
                    </div>

                        <h2>Can you have your cake and eat it?</h2>
                        <p>
                            This in itself poses enormous data management and regulatory compliance challenges, but it also offers tremendous opportunities - to build more trust, a better
                            relationship and a deeper understanding.
                        </p>

                        <p>Anyway, if the data is no longer yours, why do you want to be responsible for it?</p>

                            GDPR has been designed to allow consumers easier access to their own proprietary data and empowers them to control access. It will replace the current Data
                            Protection Act (DPA) but will be specific to any company holding European personal data whether based in Europe or the rest of the world.

                            The GDPR will apply in the UK from 25 May 2018. The government has confirmed that the UK’s decision to leave the EU will not affect the commencement of the GDPR.
